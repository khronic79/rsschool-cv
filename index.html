       <h2>About me</h2>
         <p>Almost every business is somewhat IT business. 
          Last several years I was involved in many projects 
          which involved IT developments. That is why I get 
          interested in programming. I wanted to improve in 
          this direction. My purpose is to get enough skills 
          and experience to be responsible for projects on the 
          level of team lead and architect or to start IT 
          business.
